    <p>Welcome to our prank website! We're here to have a little fun and share a serious message. As much as we love movies, we want to emphasize that downloading movies from the internet for free is not a legal or ethical practice. It's important to respect the rights of content creators and follow the law.

Downloading movies from unauthorized sources not only violates copyright laws, but it also harms the film industry by undermining the hard work and creativity that goes into making movies. It can also expose users to potential risks, such as malware, viruses, and other security threats.

At our website, we're all about harmless pranks and jokes, but we don't support or condone illegal activities. We encourage our visitors to enjoy movies through legal and legitimate means, such as streaming services, theaters, and purchasing authorized copies. Let's all be responsible and respectful movie fans!

Remember, piracy is not a victimless crime. It impacts the livelihoods of filmmakers, actors, and all those involved in the movie industry. Let's support and appreciate the art of filmmaking by consuming movies in lawful and responsible ways. Thank you for understanding and joining us in promoting positive movie-watching practices.</p>
